[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/maartenvanvliet/receivex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/maartenvanvliet/receivex) [![Hex pm](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/receivex.svg?style=flat)](https://hex.pm/packages/receivex) [![Hex Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/hex-docs-9768d1.svg)](https://hexdocs.pm/receivex) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Package that makes it easy to deal with inbound webhooks.

## Adapters

Right now [Mailgun](./lib/receivex/adapters/mailgun.ex) and [Mandrill](./lib/receivex/adapters/mandrill.ex) webhooks are supported out of the box.

You can implement your own adapter by following the existing adapters as an example.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `receivex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:receivex, "~> 0.8.2"}
  ]
end
```


Example configuration for Mandrill with the Plug router
```elixir
forward("_incoming", to: Receivex, init_opts: [
  adapter: Receivex.Adapter.Mandrill,
  adapter_opts: [
    secret: "i8PTcm8glMgsfaWf75bS1FQ",
    url: "http://example.com"
  ],
  handler: Example.Processor]
)
```

Example configuration for Mandrill with the Phoenix router
```elixir
forward("_incoming", Receivex, [
  adapter: Receivex.Adapter.Mandrill,
  adapter_opts: [
    secret: "i8PTcm8glMgsfaWf75bS1FQ",
    url: "http://example.com"
  ],
  handler: Example.Processor]
)
```

Example configuration for Mailgun with the Plug router
```elixir
forward("_incoming", to: Receivex, init_opts: [
  adapter: Receivex.Adapter.Mailgun,
  adapter_opts: [
    api_key: "some-key"
  ],
  handler: Example.Processor]
)
```

Example processor
```elixir
  defmodule Example.Processor do
    @behaviour Receivex.Handler

    def process(%Receivex.Email{} = mail) do
      IO.inspect(mail)
    end
  end

```
